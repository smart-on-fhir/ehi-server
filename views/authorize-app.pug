                    Visualizing a scenario in which patients request EHI exports
                    from registered healthcare organizations, this web application
                    is a modified version of the original App Flow mocked up by
                    the Argonaut's team. In order to explore the administration
                    side of EHI export, our application also introduces pages and
                    operations for reviewing, augmenting, rejecting, and approving
                    EHI requests. In tandem with a project implementing an EHI
                    backend server, this application provides a starting point
                    for hospital systems to build their own EHI export interfaces
                    and for the standards community to iterate on the current
                    FHIR EHI export specification.
